## Introducing 'dupmutate'
Recently (Nov 28, 2024), I’ve been diving deep into React.js and learning a lot. One concept that really stood out to me is the importance of never mutating data directly. Instead, the recommended approach is to first duplicate the data and then mutate it. This operation is so common that I thought, “Why not introduce a new term to describe these two steps—‘dupmutate’?” Excited by the idea, I shared it in a [tweet](https://x.com/devinjohw/status/1861992106350485861) and even created a GitHub repository for it.

'Dupmutate' means 'duplicate' + 'mutate', here are all forms of this word:
- dupmutate (Base)
- dupmutates (3rd Person Singular)
- dupmutating (Present Participle, Gerund)
- dupmutated (Past Tense, Past Participle)
- dupmutation (noun)
