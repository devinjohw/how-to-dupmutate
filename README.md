## Introducing 'dupmutate'
These days(Nov 28, 2024), I learned a lot about React.js. One thing I remembered strongly was that we should never mutate data, instead, we should duplicate first and then mutate. These operation is too often that I thought "What about we introduced a new term to refer to these two steps, which is 'dupmutate'". I was so exited that posted a tweet and created this github repo.

'Dupmutate' means 'duplicate' + 'mutate', here are all other forms of this word:
- dupmutate (Base)
- dupmutates (3rd Person Singular)
- dupmutating (Present Participle, Gerund)
- dupmutated (Past Tense, Past Participle)
- dupmutation (noun)
